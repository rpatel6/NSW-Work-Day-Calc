# NSW-Work-Day-Calc
This app calculates Work days in New South Wales in a given range.
Start and End dates are excluded from the calculation.
- I've provided a very trivial interface to use the calculator.
- Calculator can easily be plugged in to any program.
- I've also made sure all methods that have tedious logic are testable
- I wasn't sure if bank days were considered public holidays for all so I've excluded them (although it can be added easily)
- I decided to expose all holiday counts individually, thought it'd be useful if we wanted to know how many times x holiday appeared in the interval
